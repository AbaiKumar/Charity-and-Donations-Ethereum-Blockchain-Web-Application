The charity and donations sector is often undermined by a lack of transparency, accountability, and efficiency. Traditional charity systems rely heavily on intermediaries for fund distribution, increasing operational costs and reducing the percentage of donations that reach those in need. Additionally, donors often face uncertainty about how their contributions are being utilized, leading to a lack of trust in charitable organizations. Mismanagement or misuse of funds further exacerbates these issues, deterring potential donors and affecting the overall credibility of charitable institutions.

This project proposes a decentralized platform for charity and donations, leveraging the Ethereum blockchain to create a trust less, transparent, and efficient system. By utilizing smart contracts, the platform automates donation handling and fund distribution, ensuring that funds are released only when predefined conditions are met, such as achieving fundraising goals or reaching specific milestones. This removes the need for intermediaries and reduces associated operational costs, while providing realtime transparency for donors to track their ontributions. Additionally, the platform uses decentralized storage (IPFS) for campaign details, further enhancing security and reliability.

The decentralized nature of the platform addresses critical  challenges in the traditional charity model by ensuring transparency through immutable blockchain records, enhancing donor trust, and eliminating the risk of fund mismanagement. This report outlines the system's architecture, implementation details, results, and observations, demonstrating the potential of blockchain technology to revolutionize the charity sector by making it more transparent, accountable, and efficient.
